I am happy to welcome you to my webpage. I am currently pursuing my Doctoral studies in the IISc Bangalore. I am interested in low power VLSI design using both digital and analog circuit design techniques, approximate computing, image processing, error correction and decoding and neuromorphic system design. 

Apart from academics, travelling, music and art interest me a lot.
